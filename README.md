# TODO

- [x] Find a way to prevent enemies knowing where stealthed characters were on ambush start
  - [ ] Add an 'Ambushing' status to clearly communicate the missing 'Ghost' isn't a visual glitch
  - [ ] Add a status to indicate that a character is ambushing, but alerted the enemy due to failed check, for flavour
  - [ ] Add the ability to de-sneak a character if they critically fail their stealth check, triggering prone ('tripping' them)
    - [ ] Add Thunderclap animation/sound/noise effect to characters that 'trip' while wearing Metal armor
- [ ]  Add a toggleble passive to exclude party members from ambushes
- [ ] Force surprise on enemies when attacking them
  - [ ] Before combat starts (exclusive MCM options):
    - [ ] When stealthed
    - [ ] When not stealthed and not in sight of enemy?
    - [ ] When not stealthed and in sight of enemy?
  - [ ] On crit from stealthed char during combat?
- [ ] Distance-based eligibility
  - [ ] Implement Surface when messing with MCM value to show how big the radius is? Or find a more sensible way of doing that
- [ ] Sight-based eligibility
- [ ] Teleporting far away party members to the ambush site?
- [ ] I'm 100% sure there's gonna be multiplayer shenanigans i'll have to deal with
  - [ ] MCM notification allowing other players to opt in and have rules run?
- [ ] Flavour notification? "AMBUSH SUCCESSFUL" or something?
